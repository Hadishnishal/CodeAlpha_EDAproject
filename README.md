## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Meaningful Questions
Before performing analysis, the following questions were considered:
1. Which authors appear most frequently in the dataset?
2. What is the distribution of quote lengths?
3. Are there any missing values in the dataset?
4. Are there duplicate quotes or authors?
5. Which author has the longest average quote length?

### Data Exploration
- The dataset contains two columns: Quote and Author.
- Both columns are of object (text) data type.
- No missing values or duplicate rows were found.

### Patterns and Insights
- Some authors appear more frequently than others.
- Quote lengths vary significantly across authors.
- Visualization was used to understand quote length distribution.

### Data Quality Checks
- Missing values were checked and none were found.
- Duplicate records were checked and none were detected.
